This repository is about learning a backpropagation method of Artificial Intelligence

The backpropagation algorithm is used in the classical feed-forward artificial neural network.
It is the technique still used to train large deep learning networks.

In this tutorial, you will discover how to implement the backpropagation algorithm for a neural network from scratch with Python.

After completing this tutorial, you will know:
How to forward-propagate an input to calculate an output
How to back-propagate error and train a network
How to apply the backpropagation algorithm to a real-wrold predictive modeling problem.
